    Seraph Station

    The Seraph Station project challenged us to design a unique station that would
    transport people through time. The result is a fresh and futuristic model
    inspired by space stations.

    A sequel theme project for a tower originally built in the 1800s. We achieved
    this with a striking look of brutal minimalism with modern touches.

    Trinity Bank Tower

    Trinity Bank challenged us to make a concept for a 84 story building located
    in the middle of a city with a high earthquake frequency. For this project we
    used curves to blend design and stability to meet our objectives.
